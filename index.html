          <h2 class="testimonial_header">What Clients are Saying</h2>

          <p class="testimonial">Absolutely amazing tutor, one of the best. I have been coming to her for a year and I'm progressing rapidly with her with learning to play the violin. Fantastic teacher and highly recommended.</p>
          <p class="testimonial"><i>Emma S.</i></p>

          <p class="testimonial">I took six months of piano at age 11 and found it very stressful. Now as a senior citizen, I decided to try it again. Taryn is very easygoing, always cheerful and an amazing teacher. I don't feel the pressure I used to have and she makes learning music fun. I love Taryn. She's the best. Music is supposed to be a great exercise for the brain. So if you want to stay young, remember it's never too late.  I have been truly blessed to find such a great teacher as Taryn.</p>
          <p class="testimonial"><i>Sara S.</i></p>

          <p class="testimonial">Taryn is a wonderfully talented and accomplished musician, song writer/singer and teacher.  My 11 year old daughter is excited to study violin with her every week.  Taryn is positive, kind, supportive, smart and generous. She is a great role model for her students. She has wonderful, creative teaching techniques. My daughter is learning so much!</p>
